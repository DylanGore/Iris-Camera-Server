# Iris Camera Server

Iris camera server with facial recognition. Based on [flask-video-streaming](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming) by [Miguel Grinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg).

This can work on it's own much like the original but is intended to be used with [Iris](https://github.com/DylanGore/Iris).
